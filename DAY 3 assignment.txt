
2) 	The parent & child process concept
Ans->	A child process is a process created by a parent process in operating system 
	using a fork() system call. A child process is created as its parent process's copy 
	and inherits most of its attributes. ... 
	If a child process has no parent process, it was created directly by the kernel.


3)	Understand orphan processes
Ans->	Orphan processes are those processes that are still running even though 
	their parent process has terminated or finished. A process can be orphaned 
	intentionally or unintentionally. 
	An intentionally orphaned process runs in the background without 
	any manual support.

4)	Understand zombie processes
Ans->	A zombie process is a process whose execution is completed 
	but it still has an entry in the process table. Zombie processes usually 
	occur for child processes, 
	as the parent process still needs to read its child's exit status.

4) i]	How to kill the Zombie Process?
Ans->	The zombie processes can be removed from the system by sending the 
	SIGCHLD signal to the parent, using the kill command. If the zombie process 
	is still not eliminated from the process table by the parent process, 
	then the parent process is terminated if that is acceptable.

5)	what is getpid() and how to use it..??
Ans->	getpid() returns the process ID of the current process. 
	(This is often used by routines that generate unique temporary filenames.) 
	getppid() returns the process ID of the parent of the current process.

==========================================================================================

1)	Parent and child process 
	Write a C/CPP program to create a child process. 
	Child should print its pid and its parent’s pid and should exit by printing message as “Child Exiting …”. 
	Parent should print its pid and should exit by printing message as “Parent Exiting ..”. 
	(Hint(functions to be used) : getpid, fork, getppid) 


ANS->
--------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){
	pid_t pid;
	
	pid = fork();

	if(pid==0){
		printf("Child process is running... %d \n", getpid());
		printf(" having parent... %d \n", getppid());
	}
	else if (pid > 0){
		printf("Parent process is running... %d \n", getpid());
		printf(" having parent... %d \n", getppid());
	} 
	else{
		printf("Error...Something went wrong");
	}
}

=========================================================================================

2) 	2.Scheduling functions 
	Write a program in C/CPP to check the scheduling policy used by the process and its priority. 
	(Hint(functions to be used) : sched_getscheduler, getpid) 

ANS->

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>


int main(){
	pid_t pid;
	
	pid = fork();

	if(pid==0){
		printf("Child process is running... %d \n", getpid());
		printf(" having scheduling policy... %d \n",sched_getscheduler());
	}
	else if (pid > 0){
		printf("Parent process is running... %d \n", getpid());
		printf(" having scheduling policy... %d  \n",sched_getscheduler());
	} 
	else{
		printf("Error...Something went wrong");
	}
}


=====================================================================================================

4) 	Scheduling algorithm 
	Write a program in C/CPP to take process name, its arrival time and execution/burst time as input. 
	Use FCFS(non-preemptive) algorithm to calculate wait time of each process, average 
	wait time, turnaround time of each process and average turnaround time. 
	Calculation of time will start from the arrival time of first process.
	execution/burst time - Time required for execution of process
	Wait time of process = response time of process - arrival time process
	Response time of process : time at which process is scheduled to run
	Average wait time = (sum of wait time of each process) / (number of processes) 
	Turnaround time of process = (finish/completion time of process) - (arrival time of process)
	Average turnaround time = (sum of turnaround time of each process) / (number of processes)
